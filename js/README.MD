This is a javascript solution 
In order to run you can open your command line and navigate where the script folder and type command 
node script.js

or you can specify the physical path for the script
node c:\sample\script.js

the script doesn't depend on any library.

I also created a jsfiddle in which you can run the script online 
here is the link : https://jsfiddle.net/elhafyani4/g5fL4p9r/79/
